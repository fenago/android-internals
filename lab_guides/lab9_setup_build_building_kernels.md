Building Kernels
================

This page details the process of building custom
[kernels](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel) for
Android devices. These instructions guide you through the process of
selecting the right sources, building the kernel, and embedding the
results into a system image built from the Android Open Source Project
(AOSP).

You can acquire more recent kernel sources by using
[Repo](https://source.android.com/setup/develop/repo#init); build them
without further configuration by running `build/build.sh` from the root of your source checkout.

**Note:** The root of the kernel source checkout contains
`build/build.sh`. The Android tree contains
only prebuilt kernel binaries. The kernel trees contain the kernel
sources and all tools to build the kernels, including this script.

To build older kernels or kernels not listed on this page, refer to the
instructions on how to build [legacy
kernels](https://source.android.com/setup/build/building-kernels-deprecated).

[Downloading sources and build tools]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For recent kernels, use [`repo`](https://source.android.com/setup/develop/repo#init) to
download the sources, toolchain, and build scripts. Some kernels (for
example, the PixelÂ 3 kernels) require sources from multiple git
repositories, while others (for example, the common kernels) require
only a single source. Using the `repo`
approach ensures a correct source directory setup.

Download the sources for the appropriate branch:



``` 
mkdir android-kernel && cd android-kernel
```



``` 
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/manifest -b BRANCH
```



``` 
repo sync
```

The following table lists the `BRANCH` names
for kernels available through this method.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

**Note:** You can switch among different branches within one Repo
checkout. The common kernel manifests (and most others) define the
kernel git repository to be cloned fully (not shallow), which enables
fast switching among them. Switching to a different branch is similar to
initializing a branch; the `-u` parameter is
optional. For example, to switch to
`common-android-mainline` from your existing
Repo checkout, run:\
`$ repo init -b common-android-mainline && repo sync`.

[Building the kernel]
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Then build the kernel with this:



``` 
build/build.sh
```

**Note:** Common kernels are generic, customizable kernels and therefore
don\'t define a default configuration. See [Customize the kernel
build](https://source.android.com/setup/build/building-kernels#customize-build)
to find out how to specify the build configuration for common kernels.
For example, to build the GKI kernel for the aarch64 platform, run:\
`$ BUILD_CONFIG=common/build.config.gki.aarch64 build/build.sh`

The kernel binary, modules, and corresponding image are located in the
`out/BRANCH/dist` directory.

### [Building the GKI modules]

Android 11 introduced
[GKI](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/generic-kernel-image),
which separates the kernel into a Google-maintained kernel image and
vendor maintained-modules, which are built separately.

This example shows a kernel image configuration:



``` 
BUILD_CONFIG=common/build.config.gki.x86_64 build/build.sh
```

This example shows a module configuration (Cuttlefish and Emulator):



``` 
BUILD_CONFIG=common-modules/virtual-device/build.config.cuttlefish.x86_64 build/build.sh
```

In Android 12 Cuttlefish and Goldfish converge, so they share the same
kernel: `virtual_device`. To build that
kernel\'s modules, use this build configuration:



``` 
BUILD_CONFIG=common-modules/virtual-device/build.config.virtual_device.x86_64 build/build.sh
```

[Running the kernel]
--------------------------------------------------------------------

There are multiple ways to run a custom-built kernel. The following are
known ways suitable for various development scenarios.

### [Embedding into the Android image build]

Copy `Image.lz4-dtb` to the respective kernel
binary location within the AOSP tree and rebuild the boot image.

Alternatively, define the `TARGET_PREBUILT_KERNEL` variable while using `make bootimage` (or any other `make` command line
that builds a boot image). This variable is supported by all devices as
it\'s set up via `device/common/populate-new-device.sh`. For example:



``` 
export TARGET_PREBUILT_KERNEL=DIST_DIR/Image.lz4-dtb
```

### [Flashing and booting kernels with fastboot]

Most recent devices have a bootloader extension to streamline the
process of generating and booting a boot image.

To boot the kernel without flashing:



``` 
adb reboot bootloader
fastboot boot Image.lz4-dtb
```

Using this method, the kernel isn\'t actually flashed, and won\'t
persist across a reboot.

**Note:** Kernel names differ by device. To locate the correct filename
for your kernel, refer to `device/VENDOR/NAME-kernel` in the AOSP tree.

Customizing the kernel build
----------------------------

The build process and outcome can be influenced by environment
variables. Most of them are optional and each kernel branch should come
with a proper default configuration. The most frequently used ones are
listed here. For a complete (and up-to-date) list, refer to
`build/build.sh`.

[Custom kernel config for local builds]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need to switch a kernel configuration option regularly, for
example, when working on a feature, or if you need an option to be set
for development purposes, you can achieve that flexibility by
maintaining a local modification or copy of the build config.

Set the variable `POST_DEFCONFIG_CMDS` to a
statement that is evaluated right after the usual
`make defconfig` step is done. As the
`build.config` files are sourced into the
build environment, functions defined in `build.config` can be called as part of the post-defconfig commands.

A common example is disabling link time optimization (LTO) for
crosshatch kernels during development. While LTO is beneficial for
released kernels, the overhead at build time can be significant. The
following snippet added to the local `build.config` disables LTO persistently when using
`build/build.sh`.



``` 
POST_DEFCONFIG_CMDS="check_defconfig && update_debug_config"
function update_debug_config() {
    $/.config \
         -d LTO \
         -d LTO_CLANG \
         -d CFI \
         -d CFI_PERMISSIVE \
         -d CFI_CLANG
    (cd $ && \
     make O=$ olddefconfig)
}
```

[Identifying kernel versions]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can identify the correct version to build from two sources: the AOSP
tree and the system image.

### [Kernel version from AOSP tree]

The AOSP tree contains prebuilt kernel versions. The git log reveals the
correct version as part of the commit message:



``` 
cd $AOSP/device/VENDOR/NAME
git log --max-count=1
```

If the kernel version isn\'t listed in the git log, obtain it from the
system image, as described below.

### [Kernel version from system image]

To determine the kernel version used in a system image, run the
following command against the kernel file:



``` 
file kernel
```

For `Image.lz4-dtb` files, run:



``` 
grep -a 'Linux version' Image.lz4-dtb
```

[Building a Boot Image]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

It\'s possible to build a boot image using the kernel build environment.
To do this you need a ramdisk binary, which you can obtain by
downloading a GKI boot image and unpacking it. Any GKI boot image from
the associated Android release will work.



``` 
tools/mkbootimg/unpack_bootimg.py --boot_img=boot-5.4-gz.img
mv tools/mkbootimg/out/ramdisk gki-ramdisk.lz4
```

The target folder is the top-level directory of the kernel tree (the
current working directory).

If you\'re developing with AOSP master, you can instead download the
`ramdisk-recovery.img` build artifact from an
aosp\_arm64 build on [ci.android.com](https://ci.android.com/) and use
that as your ramdisk binary.

When you have a ramdisk binary and have copied it to
`gki-ramdisk.lz4` in the root directory of the
kernel build, you can generate a boot image by executing:



``` 
BUILD_BOOT_IMG=1 SKIP_VENDOR_BOOT=1 KERNEL_BINARY=Image GKI_RAMDISK_PREBUILT_BINARY=gki-ramdisk.lz4 BUILD_CONFIG=common/build.config.gki.aarch64 build/build.sh
```

If you\'re working with x86-based architecture, replace
`Image` with `bzImage`, and `aarch64` with
`x86_64`:



``` 
BUILD_BOOT_IMG=1 SKIP_VENDOR_BOOT=1 KERNEL_BINARY=bzImage GKI_RAMDISK_PREBUILT_BINARY=gki-ramdisk.lz4 BUILD_CONFIG=common/build.config.gki.x86_64 build/build.sh
```

That file is located in the artifact directory
`$KERNEL_ROOT/out/$KERNEL_VERSION/dist`.

The boot image is located at
`out/<kernel branch>/dist/boot.img`.
